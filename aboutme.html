                <p class="bold-p">How I got started</p>
                <p>
                    I have always been a very logical, technical and a problem-solver of a person.
                    These natural tendecies lead to me taking the path towards becoming a frontend developer. I have found
                    a suitable online program through which I have learned many aspects of HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. 
                </p>
                <p class="bold-p">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p>
                    Obvioulsy online learning is not he easiest path. However, by keeping the end goal in mind all the time
                    I manage to maintain continous progress. I also use my work on differente projects to keep myself engaged.
                    This project-based approach of learning does not only keep me focused, but it also keeps my mind stimulated, and
                    it stretches my thinking to great lengths.

                This was another time well spent in learnig and creating. I see myself growing with every solo project.
                The interactive nature of this web app is spectacular. Moreover, the presentation with effective
                CSS makes it appealing to the eye and enjoyable to the user.

                One of the key features here was to use JavaScript in order to generated HTML. This was stimulatin and a 
                challenging exercise. Additionally, event listerners had to be used effectively to get the web app working
                appropriately.

            <h1>Zaid's Diner</h1>
            <p>
                This is a project that mimics an ordering app. Apart from the general design of the project, a lot
                had to be put in play. I had to write a good amount of JavaScript for the functionality of the project.
                This project allowed my problem-solving in coding to advance even further.
