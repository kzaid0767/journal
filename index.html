            <h1>My journey as a web dev</h1>
            <p>
                I have always been a very logical, technical and a problem-solver of a person.
                This is the new beginning in my journey in the learning of web development. I am trekking this path 
                with the objective of realising my dream as a fullstack developer.

            <h1>Hometown Project</h1>
            <p>
                After several weeks of learning of learning HTML and CSS I finally worked on my first project.
                This project allowed me to put my learning into action. A first acomplishment but not the last.

            <h1>Scoreboard</h1>
            <p>
                This was project focused on making websites interactive. In thi production I achieved a nice use of 
                JavaScript and HTML by making this functional scoreboard.

            <h1>Password Generator</h1>
            <p>
                This is yet another project. Much randomness was added to this production in generating a new password
                each time. The copying to clipboard is also an exquisite feature of this web app. I enjoy the ability to
                between dark and light modes.

            <h1>Unit Converter</h1>
            <p>
                This was another time well spent in learnig and creating. I see myself growing with every solo project.
                The interactive nature of this web app is spectacular. Moreover, the presentation with effective
                CSS makes it appealing to the eye and enjoyable to the user.

            <h1>Oldgram</h1>
            <p>
                One of the key features here was to use JavaScript in order to generated HTML. This was stimulatin and a 
                challenging exercise. Additionally, event listerners had to be used effectively to get the web app working
                appropriately.

            <h1>Zaid's Diner</h1>
            <p>
                This is a project that mimics an ordering app. Apart from the general design of the project, a lot
                had to be put in play. I had to write a good amount of JavaScript for the functionality of the project.
                This project allowed my problem-solving in coding to advance even further.
